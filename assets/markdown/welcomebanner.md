RIEEE DataDash is a lightweight, open-source, two-factor secure web application platform purpose-built to facilitate the innovative research of [Research Institute of Environment, Energy, and Economics](https://rieee.appstate.edu/) partners here at [Appalachian State University](https://www.appstate.edu/).

With DataDash, RIEEE has developed full-stack capacity for secure, highly interactive web applications for research - no expensive or restrictive third-party software licenses required, and no "classroom-freemium" models.  

RIEEE hopes also to expand data science competency across the Appalachian community of scholars and significantly lower the threshold for research application development and maintenance.  To this end, we have been developing this platform with self-documentation practices, open access guides, templates, and educational resources for application development.

As this is pre-announcement, these open access resources are not yet open.  Check back soon for updates!
