Welcome to DataDash!  This web application is RIEEE's [TODO] to meeting research partners' data infrastructure needs.  DataDash accomplishes this by allowing RIEEE to deploy web application and database server resources in a code-agnostic, shibboleth-secure, and carefully documented manner throughout the research lifecycle.  To learn more about how this is done and how it benefits research, checkout the Introduction to DataDash dashboard in the Public Dashboards section.
