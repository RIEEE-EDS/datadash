RIEEE DataDash is a lightweight, open-source, two-factor secure web application platform purpose-built to facilitate the innovative research of [Research Institute of Environment, Energy, and Economics](https://rieee.appstate.edu/) partners here at [Appalachian State University](https://www.appstate.edu/).

With DataDash, RIEEE has developed full-stack capacity for secure, highly interactive web applications for research - no expensive or restrictive third-party software licenses required, and no "classroom-freemium" models.  

RIEEE hopes also to use this platform to expand data science competency across the Appalachian community of scholars and significantly lower the threshold for research application development and maintenance.  

To that end, this platform is actively being further developed with self-documentation practices, open access guides, templates, and educational resources for application development.

As this is pre-announcement, these open access resources are not yet open.  Check back soon for updates!
  
### Release Notes: Version 1.0.0 
  
**October 30th, 2023**
  
Today marks the first ever launch of RIEEE DataDash to production.  
  
A special thanks is due, in large part, to Jeff Tickle, Enterprise Solutions Architect at ITS, who is not only an in-the-trenches ally but also a valuable team member of Appalachian's Research Computing Services group. Special appreciation also goes out to our research partners and data producers, as well as the entire RIEEE team. This powerful technology would not have been possible without your continued support.
