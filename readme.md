# RIEEE's DataDash

Welcome to DataDash!  This web application is RIEEE's answer to meeting much of our research partners' data infrastructure demand.  DataDash accomplishes this by allowing RIEEE to deploy web application and database server resources in a code-agnostic, shibboleth-secure, and carefully documented manner throughout the research lifecycle.  To learn more about how this is done and how it benefits research, checkout the Introduction to DataDash dashboard in the Public Dashboards section of the application.

## Development Notes

### July 13th, 2023

- Come back to the idea of unlisted embedded applications if and only if that really seems necessary.
