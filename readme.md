# RIEEE DataDash

RIEEE DataDash is a lightweight, open-source, two-factor secure web application platform purpose-built to facilitate the innovative research of Research Institute of Environment, Energy, and Economics partners here at AppState.

With DataDash, RIEEE has developed full-stack capacity for secure, highly interactive web applications for research - no expensive or restrictive third-party software licenses required, and no strategic classroom-freemium model.

RIEEE also hopes to expand data science competency on campus and significantly lower the threshold for research application development and maintenence. To achieve this, we have been developing this platform with self-documentation practices, open access guides, templates, and educational resources for application development.
